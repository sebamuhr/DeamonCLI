# Beat Studio (native desktop) — PROGRESS

**This is the living status doc for the NATIVE desktop app. Read this first when
continuing in a new chat.** Current version: **v0.26.1** (shown in the window title bar as
`Beat Studio · v0.26.1 · AI matching ✓`).

## v0.26.1 — board buttons truly keep their shape · "Original" acts on the whole soundwave (no points)
- **Stop button shape fix (for real):** the `■` stop style used a hard-coded `_STOP_CSS` that dropped the
  green buttons' `padding:8px 14px;font-weight:600`, so a preview button (Mix/Original/Both) visibly
  shrank when playing. Now `_stop_css_from(css)` derives the red style from each button's OWN play style
  (only the colour hexes change → identical geometry), and the three preview buttons are pinned to a
  fixed width that fits BOTH the ▶ and ■ label, so the flip never resizes them (verified play==stop width
  for all three).
- **"Original" no longer needs points:** selecting Original now plays your WHOLE recording through the FX
  rack from the start — `_lane_events` emits a single whole-take event (`beat=0`, `src_dur=take length`,
  `play_original=True`, `fx`) regardless of drawn points, sitting on top of the soundwave. The empty-row
  hint for an Original track now says so instead of "click to place points".

## v0.26.0 — Save/Open as MIDI (portable) + full-fidelity .beat sidecar
The Save button used to write JSON only. Now **Save → MIDI so the groove opens in any DAW**, without
losing the parts MIDI can't hold:
- **`persistence.save_song(p, path)`** writes a standard **`.mid`** AND a full-fidelity **`.beat`** sidecar
  (JSON `to_dict`, i.e. synths/FX/volume automation/board provenance) next to it. Returns the .mid path.
- **`persistence.open_song(path)`** opens `.beat`/`.json` directly; for a `.mid` it prefers a matching
  `.beat` sidecar (full fidelity) and otherwise **imports the raw MIDI** (`import_midi`).
- **`export_midi`** rewritten to **multi-track**: a named track per lane, drums on channel 10 (GM notes),
  melodic/synth lanes on their own channels — opens cleanly in other software.
- **`import_midi`** builds a Project from any `.mid`: channel-10 notes → one drum lane per GM note
  (reverse `DRUM_NOTE`), other channels → synth lanes with pitch/velocity/length.
- Studio wiring: the toolbar **Save** + File ▸ *Save (MIDI + project)* (Ctrl+S) call `save_song`; File ▸
  *Open (MIDI / project)* (Ctrl+O) accepts `*.mid *.beat *.json` via `open_song`; File ▸ *Export MIDI
  (notes only)* (Ctrl+E) stays a plain notes-only export (no sidecar).
Verified: round-trip test (save → reopen via sidecar keeps fx/vol_pts/bpm; delete sidecar → raw MIDI
import rebuilds drum+synth lanes with correct pitches; the .mid re-reads in mido as Tempo+per-lane
tracks) and a Studio-level save→open smoke test.

## v0.25.0 — Phase 3 (Grid + Fit timing tools) & Phase 4 (Original instrument + FX rack)
The last two plan phases landed together.

**Phase 3 — Pen / Grid / Fit tool selector in the board toolbar** (`separationboard.py`):
- `CurveCanvas.tool` ∈ {pen, grid, fit} gates the mouse; a segmented control (✎ Pen · ⇋ Grid · ⤢ Fit) in
  the top bar switches it (`_set_tool`, lit purple when active).
- **Grid stretch (uniform tempo)** — in Grid mode a horizontal drag grabs the beat under the cursor and
  keeps it there, so `beat_len` (hence bpm) scales the WHOLE grid uniformly, like dragging Excel column
  borders. Emits `grid_scaled(bpm)` → `_on_grid_scaled` → mirrors the box + `bpm_changed` → the Studio
  rescales all beats. Tempo changes are now undoable (`_set_bpm` schedules a debounced commit).
- **Fit tool (two-point tape-style audio stretch)** — click A, click B → a shaded region with edge
  handles; drag the B handle and release to **resample that slice** (`np.interp`, tape-style so pitch
  shifts) to its new length, splicing `before + stretched + after` into a NEW take buffer; a dashed
  marker + `×N.NN` label preview the amount. `_apply_fit` remaps every drawn point on that take through a
  piecewise time map (before = unchanged · inside = scaled · after = shifted), drops beat-locks in/after
  the region, re-pads other takes to the new length, and emits `tracks_changed("")` → resync + undo.

**Phase 4 — "Original" instrument + per-track FX rack** (`synth.py`, `separationboard.py`, `render.py`,
`model.py`, `persistence.py`, `mainwindow.py`):
- The board instrument picker gains **"Original"** (`_collapse_items`). Choosing it sets
  `tr["kind"]="original"`, unfolds an **FX RACK** under the picker (built from `synth.FX_KNOBS` with the
  existing `_knob_row`), and makes `_lane_events` emit per-anchor hits on a `play_original=True` lane
  carrying `fx` — so each drawn dot plays YOUR recorded slice, transformed.
- New `synth.apply_fx(buf, fx)` chain (order: **Drive → Bass → Lowpass → Crush → Chorus → Delay →
  Reverb → Punch**), each an amount slider 0..1 (0 = bypass). May lengthen the buffer (reverb/delay
  tail); `synth.fx_tail()` sizes it. `default_fx()`/`FX_KNOBS` mirror the synth-knob pattern.
- **Per-lane render** now applies `apply_fx(lane_buf, lane.fx)` before the volume envelope and grows the
  master tail by the largest FX tail. `Lane.fx` round-trips in `persistence` and rides the board→Studio
  upsert (`play_original` + `fx` carried alongside `sound_params`/`lo_note`).
Verified headless (`board_check.py`, v0.25.0): GRID (drag rescales tempo + syncs), FIT (region resample
shortens the take + remaps points), plus a standalone FX check (each effect changes the buffer; reverb
adds a tail) and an Original-lane render. Screenshot `scratchpad/board_p34.png` shows all of it.

## v0.24.0 — Phase 2: per-track VOLUME automation line + V button + per-lane render
The Studio now has editable per-track **volume automation** (Plan Phase 2):
- **V button** — a 5th right-side header button (REC · S · **V** · M · ⚙), lit cyan when that lane's
  volume line is shown (`headers.py`, recomputed `bx` for 5 buttons; emits `action(lane_id, "vol")`).
- **The line** (`timeline.py`) — `self.vol_lanes: set` of lanes showing their line. Drawn in
  `drawForeground` in the lane colour: a polyline across the row (top = 1.5× gain, unity 1.0 marked by a
  dashed reference line, bottom = silent), holding flat before the first / after the last node, with
  draggable dots. **Click empty** = add a node (beat snapped), **drag** a dot = move (beat+gain),
  **right-click / double-click** a dot = delete. Editing is gated to lanes with V on, so it never
  collides with event editing. Gestures emit `edited` (live re-render) then `committed` (undo snapshot).
- **Per-lane render** (`render.py`, the backbone refactor) — `render_project` now renders **each lane
  into its own buffer**, multiplies by that lane's volume envelope (`_vol_gain` samples `vol_pts` over
  time via `np.interp`, unity when empty), then sums into the master. This is also the home for Phase 4
  FX. `vol_pts` already round-trips in `persistence` and is captured by the undo snapshot.
- Wiring: `mainwindow._on_header_action` handles `"vol"` (toggle `timeline.vol_lanes`).
Verified headless (`board_check.py`, v0.24.0): new VOLUME check (V toggles the line; a `vol_pts` dip
renders measurably quieter) + a screenshot (`scratchpad/vol_line.png`) showing the curve + nodes.

## v0.23.0 — Phase 1: real synth length · undo both windows · play/pause/stop transport · board buttons keep shape
Four things landed:
1. **Synth note length fix** (Plan Phase 1a) — `board._lane_events` computed a synth Event's `length`
   from the take-**fraction** span instead of **seconds** (`(t1-t0)*dur/beat_len`, `dur=len(buf)/sr`), so
   a full-take synth line rendered as a ~2-frame block on the Studio grid. Now it spans the whole grid.
   Verified `length=3.73 beats` for a full-width siren.
2. **Undo/redo affects BOTH windows** (Plan Phase 1b) — the undo entry is now a blob
   `{"project": to_dict(project), "board": board.snapshot()}`. New `SeparationBoard.snapshot()/restore()`
   serialise tracks (points/params, colours as hex) + takes (buffers by reference) + bpm/active-take;
   `MainWindow._commit/_undo/_redo` restore both sides under the `_syncing` guard. `board_check` UNDO test
   rewritten to draw an anchor, commit, undo → asserts BOTH the board points AND the project revert.
3. **Studio transport is now Play → Pause → Stop** — the ▶ button becomes **⏸ while playing**; pressing it
   **pauses in place** (remembers `_paused_beat`, resumes from there). The separate **■ Stop** button
   rewinds to the start. Reaching the end resets to ▶ from the top. (`toolbar.set_playing`,
   `mainwindow._toggle_play/_play_from/_stop/_tick`.)
4. **Board play buttons keep their shape** — flipping to Stop now swaps only the ▶ glyph for ■ and keeps
   the same label/width (`"▶ Mix"→"■ Mix"`, not `"■ Stop"`); removed the bold weight that widened them.
Verified headless (`board_check.py`, v0.23.0, all checks green + a transport pause/resume/stop smoke test).

## v0.22.2 — pen tool: click = straight, click-and-hold = curve, right-click = delete (the original feel)
User clarified the wanted behaviour: **one click = straight point, click-and-drag = curved point,
right-click = remove** (not auto-smoothed). Reverted v0.22.1's Catmull-Rom auto-smoothing. `seg_ctrls`
is now handle-only (controls sit on the anchors → straight; a hand-pulled handle bends that end), shared
by the canvas paint and `_sample_curve`. Verified: plain clicks → straight zig-zag (`ref/autosmooth.png`),
click-drag still pulls a curve handle (`board_check` curve-handle check green), right-click deletes.

## v0.22.0 — SYNTH = a SIREN (Phase A of the morph redesign): line drives pitch+timbre, one sustained note
User's redesign of the synth track (Q&A-locked). The drawn line on a **synth** track is no longer a
volume envelope — it's a **morph + pitch curve** like a police siren:
- **One continuous sustained morphing note** across the whole drawn line (not per-point hits, no SILENCE
  split). Bottom of the line = **Base** sound at the **Low note**; top = **Modulator** sound at the
  **High note**. The curve glides BOTH pitch and timbre → `kiiiiicktooooomkiiiick`. Even a one-shot drum
  used as a synth sound is held as a sustained tone.
- **New engine `synth.morph_glide(base, mod, lo_note, hi_note, dur, morph, …)`** — per-sample pitch from
  the curve (`note = lo + m*(hi-lo)`), timbre crossfade base→mod by the same curve, de-clicked edges,
  constant amplitude. `synth.glide_voice()` sustains ANY sound: tonal drums→fundamental oscillator, noisy
  drums→filtered noise, waves→their oscillator (`_GLIDE_WAVE`/`_GLIDE_NOISE`). `render._voice_for` routes
  a synth Event's `env` (the morph curve) through `morph_glide` with the lane's note range.
- **Low/High note pickers** added to the synth panel (per track, default C3→C5). `separationboard._lane_events`
  now emits ONE synth Event spanning first→last point, `env` = the drawn height sampled (0..1), `pitch=None`.
- Model: `Lane.lo_note`/`hi_note` (+ `vol_pts` reserved for Phase B); round-tripped in persistence and the
  Studio upsert.
Verified headless (`board_check.py`, v0.22.0, 18 checks incl. SIREN: pitch rises with the line, one
sustained morph note). Screenshot `ref/synth-designer.png` (BASE▁low / MOD▔high / Pitch low→high).
**NOTE this is audio the assistant can't hear — the user should test the siren sound before Phase B/C.**
NEXT: **Phase B** = a per-track editable VOLUME automation line on the Studio (all tracks; loudness moved
here off the synth line) + a new **V** button in the track header (next to Solo) to show/hide it. **Phase C**
= draw the rendered synth morph WAVEFORM behind the beats on synth lanes.

## v0.21.0 — per-button play/stop · secondary = its own take ROW · playhead live in both · fine grain · grid-add makes a point
Follow-up fixes on v0.20.0's four features:
- **Per-button play/stop (not global).** Only the button you pressed shows **■**; pressing another stops
  it and starts the new one; pressing the playing one stops. Board now tracks a single `_play_btn`
  (`_set_play_btn`/`_toggle_preview`/`clear_playing`) instead of flipping every button. `TrackRow.preview_sound`
  carries its own button so Base/Morph toggle independently.
- **Record secondary = a NEW take ROW** (own colour) under the main, not mixed on top. The canvas is now
  **multi-take**: `CurveCanvas.set_takes()` + per-row band geometry (`_band(i)`, band-aware `_to_px`/
  `_from_px`/`_apx`, `_track_band`/`_active_band`); each take draws its own waveform + name + 0–10 scale,
  bar lines span all rows. A track binds to a take (`tr["take"]`); new tracks draw over the active take.
  `SeparationBoard.add_take()` (replaces overdub); `set_take` rebuilds the take list. The secondary audio
  is also mixed into `_orig_rec` so ▶ Original / Both play it back (fixes "recorded it, pressed play, gone").
- **Red playhead live in BOTH windows.** Board `playhead_moved` signal → `MainWindow._on_board_playhead`
  drives the Studio grid line during board previews; the transport `_tick` drives the board canvas line.
- **Finer grain.** The board dot's exact x now drives its beat (`_beat_of` drawn-position, no onset snap —
  `src_t`/audio stays onset-refined), and the grid is finer (`project.grid=16`, 1/16-of-a-beat) so even a
  ~2 ms nudge on the board moves the Studio beat while staying in tempo.
- **Grid-add makes a board point.** Adding a beat on a synced grid row now creates a matching board anchor
  in `_sync_grid_to_board` — x = its snapped time, y = **interpolated between the neighbouring points**
  (`_interp_v`) — instead of being dropped on the next regenerate.
Verified headless (`board_check.py`, v0.21.0, 17 checks): PLAY/STOP (per-button), RECORD SECONDARY (new
take row + binding), GRAIN (tiny nudge moves the beat), GRID-ADD (new grid beat → board point), plus all
prior. Screenshots `ref/multitake.png`, `ref/board-playstop.png`.

## v0.20.0 — global play/stop · BPM always synced · Record secondary (overdub) · linked beat selection
Four cross-window fixes so the two screens feel like one instrument:
- **Global play/stop.** Every play button on the board (Mix / Original / Both, per-track ▶, and the
  Base/Morph ▶) flips to **■** while anything is previewing, and clicking ANY of them stops everything.
  Board owns `_playing` + `set_playing(on)` (flips all buttons via `_mark_play`/`_flip_play`); handlers
  toggle; `stop_cb` → `MainWindow._stop_preview` (stops one-shot AND the transport stream, new
  `AudioEngine.stop_one_shot()` = `sd.stop()`). Board previews `engine.stop()` first (no overlap);
  starting/stopping the Studio transport resets the board buttons. Short sound previews auto-reset via a
  1 s single-shot timer; pattern previews reset when the playhead finishes.
- **BPM always matches.** On a new take the detected tempo is now authoritative for BOTH windows
  (`_on_calc_done` sets `project.bpm` + toolbar spinbox), on top of the existing two-way `bpm_changed`/
  `set_bpm_external` mirroring.
- **Record secondary (overdub).** Renamed board "Record master" → **● Record main**; added **＋ Record
  secondary**. Secondary plays the MAIN take in the background (`engine.play(orig_rec)`) while the mic
  records at the same tempo, then mixes the new sound INTO the board wave without disturbing any track
  (`SeparationBoard.overdub()` — same length so all drawn points stay valid; `_toggle_secondary_record`/
  `_stop_secondary_record`, `_rec_lane="__secondary__"`). This is the "extra drum/soundwave on top" layer.
- **Linked beat selection.** Picking an anchor on the board rings it AND selects the matching beat on the
  Studio grid; selecting a beat on the grid rings the drawn anchor. `CurveCanvas.point_selected` +
  `sel_pts`/`set_selected_pts`; `MainWindow._on_board_point_selected` / `_on_grid_selection` map via
  `Event.src_pts`, guarded by `_sel_syncing`; `timeline.selection_changed` now wired.
Verified headless (`board_check.py`, v0.20.0): PLAY/STOP (all buttons toggle together, any click stops),
LINKED SELECTION (both ways), RECORD SECONDARY (overdub keeps length+tracks), plus all prior checks.
Screenshots `ref/board-playstop.png`, `ref/synth-designer.png`.

## v0.19.0 — stable track colours · empty Studio start · big Synth designer (Base+Morph knobs) · fix track selection
Round of user fixes on the Separation Board:
- **Track colours are now STABLE.** Removing the top track no longer recolours the others. Each board
  track mints a colour from a monotonic `_color_seq` (never re-assigned on delete) and carries it as
  `Lane.color` (hex). The Studio paints via new `theme.lane_color_of(lane, i)` (lane's own colour, else
  index). `_delete_track` stopped renumbering colours; `set_take` resets the sequence. Round-trips in
  persistence.
- **The Studio starts EMPTY.** `model.empty_project()` returns zero lanes (was Kick/Snare/Hat/Square) —
  tracks only appear as you create them on the separator, one by one (verified `lanes 0->1`).
- **Track selection fixed.** You couldn't reliably re-select a row (child widgets — name field, combos,
  sliders — swallowed the click). `TrackRow` now installs an event filter on all its children so a press
  ANYWHERE on the row selects it. And the **canvas only edits the ACTIVE track**: `CurveCanvas._hit`
  searches just the selected track, so other tracks' dots are inert — you pick a track from the list
  first, then draw/grab its dots (no accidental cross-grab).
- **Synth designer is now big.** Synth = ONE 'Synth' entry, but Base AND Modulator each get their own
  waveform selector, a small ▶ play button (hear that sound alone), and a full knob stack:
  **Octave · Cutoff · Reso · Attack · Release · Drive · Level** (`synth.SYNTH_KNOBS`, identity defaults so
  an untouched synth sounds exactly like before). New `synth.voice(preset, freq, dur, vel, params)`
  applies the knobs (octave pitch, `_shape` = level→drive(tanh)→resonant LP `_rlp`→attack/release
  envelope); `morph_env` renders Base and Modulator each through `voice()` with `base_params`/`mod_params`
  and crossfades by the drawn line. Model: `Lane.sound_params`/`sound_b_params` (+ board `tr["params"]`/
  `params_b`, `Event` unchanged). Board ▶ per sound via new `preview_sound_cb` → `_preview_synth_sound`.
Verified headless (`board_check.py`, v0.19.0): COLOURS (stable across delete + on the lane), SELECTION
(non-active tracks inert), SYNTH KNOBS (params on the lane + audibly change the voice — cutoff/drive),
empty-start (`lanes 0->1`), colour reaches the Studio lane, PLUS all prior live-sync checks. Screenshot
`ref/synth-designer.png`.

## v0.18.1 — LIVE BIDIRECTIONAL SYNC between the Separator and the Studio ("mix both screens")
The two windows are now **fully live and bidirectional** — no more one-shot "Create these tracks"
button. Create/draw on the separator and it appears on the Studio grid instantly; move/quantize/delete
a note on the grid and the drawn line follows; tempo is synced both ways; **closing the Studio closes
the separator**. Plan: `partitioned-singing-galaxy.md`.
- **Ownership rule:** the board's drawn `points` own **shape + volume**; the Studio grid owns **timing**
  ("here is the grid what rules"). New sounds are created only on the separator. There is exactly ONE
  event generator — `board._lane_events` — so the reverse path never edits Events directly; it edits
  board points then regenerates that lane's events, making shape/volume preservation automatic (`env`
  is always re-sampled from the curve).
- **Shared identity:** a board track and its Studio lane share a stable id (`tr["lane_id"] == Lane.id
  == Lane.src_master`, minted in `add_track`). Each point gets `"id": uid("p")` (`_ensure_pt_ids`
  backfills). `Event` gained `src_track` + `src_pts` (provenance: which anchor(s) an event came from).
  All three round-trip through `persistence`. Points may carry `pt["beat"]` = grid-authoritative snapped
  beat; when present `_lane_events` uses it and **skips onset-refine** (kills the "refine jump").
- **Board → Studio (live upsert):** `SeparationBoard.tracks_changed=Signal(str)` (affected lane_id, ""
  = structural) fires from add/delete track, row changes, and `CurveCanvas.edited` (release + right-click
  delete, throttled during drag). `MainWindow._on_board_track_changed` upserts **only that lane**:
  mutates the existing lane in place (keeps mute/solo/eq/order), replaces just its events, keeps lane
  order == board track order. Guarded by `self._syncing`; debounced `_commit` (400 ms) = one undo entry
  per gesture.
- **Studio → Board (reverse map):** `timeline.committed → _sync_grid_to_board()`. Instrument events map
  1:1 to anchors (`pt["beat"]=snap(e.beat)`, `pt["t"]`, `pt["v"]=vel`; `hx/hy` shape kept); synth regions
  shift member anchors by the beat delta; grid-deleted events remove their anchor(s); then re-`_lane_events`.
- **Tempo both ways:** `bpm_changed`/`set_bpm_external` mirror the spinboxes (blockSignals), rescaling beats.
- **Lifecycle:** `MainWindow.closeEvent` closes + `deleteLater()` the parentless board window.
- **Undo coherence (Risk #1):** `_undo`/`_redo` call `_sync_grid_to_board()` after restoring the project
  so drawn anchors realign to the restored grid without divergence.
- **Record master** now lives only on the separator (removed from the main toolbar).
Verified headless (`board_check.py`, v0.18.1): FORWARD add_track→lane + draw→events; REVERSE move
(beat-lock + shape preserved) & delete; TEMPO both ways; LOOP-GUARD bounded (2 calls); UNDO realign;
LIFECYCLE close. `LIVE SYNC WORKS ✓`.
KNOWN / next: Phase 2 "record an extra beatbox on top" (layering — board points → absolute seconds,
`set_take` appends) is deferred; synth designer knobs (filter/ADSR/LFO/drive/glide/pitch) still pending.

## v0.17.1 — the line FOLLOWS (env) + 0–10 volume scale + per-anchor beats + fullscreen-on-stop fix
Round of user fixes on the modulation model:
- **Full screen no longer exits on Stop.** Root cause: `_on_calc_done`/`_open_separator` called
  `board.showNormal()` which forces the window out of full screen. New `MainWindow._show_board()`
  shows/raises WITHOUT changing window state (verified: fullscreen True → still True after a
  record→calc_done cycle).
- **The line is now a continuous VOLUME + MORPH envelope the sound FOLLOWS** (was flat / endpoint-only
  morph). `separationboard._lane_events` samples the Bézier and, for a **synth**, each run of the line
  above `SILENCE`(0.03) becomes ONE held note carrying `Event.env` = the curve sampled over the note
  (0..1). `render._voice_for` → new `synth.morph_env(base, mod, freq, dur, env)` which follows env
  **sample-by-sample**: amplitude = env (swell/fade like the drawing) AND morph = env (0 → base,
  1 → modulator). So a line that fades in to 9, dips to 0, rises to 5, long-fades to 10 sounds exactly
  like that, morphing as it rises. (This replaces the endpoint m0→m1 ramp / known-limitation.)
- **Each point is a beat / makes a sound.** For **instruments** (drums/samples) every anchor above
  `SILENCE` = a discrete HIT whose velocity = the point's height (per-anchor, not region). Dips to 0
  separate synth notes. `HIT_THRESH`/`_regions`/`_hits_of` removed.
- **0–10 volume scale** drawn down the left gutter (0 = centre/silent, 10 = top/loudest); left margin
  `LM=30`. Height on this scale = the note's volume (and, for synth, its morph amount).
Model/persistence: `Event.env` added (JSON-serialized, rounded). Verified `board_check.py`: synth
line → 1 held note, 78-pt env that rises>0.7 & starts<0.3; drums per-anchor (3 anchors→3 hits);
render 4.5 s; Create lands 3 tracks/9 events. Screenshot `ref/board-vol.png`.
KNOWN: synth held note pitch is fixed 60 (per-hit pitch + the D knobs are next); amplitude=morph are
coupled to one line (a separate morph line could decouple them later).

## v0.17.0 — SYNTH MORPH + curve-as-modulator (plan items B & C) + compare previews (A)
- **A (v0.16.4): compare previews** — separator bottom bar has **▶ Mix / ▶ Original / ▶ Both**
  (`_render_pattern` splits render from play; `_preview_original` plays `_orig_rec`; `_preview_both`
  mixes drawn+original with soft-clip). All sweep the red playhead.
- **B: Synth is ONE instrument, two fields.** Board picker `_collapse_items` = drums + a single
  **"Synth"** + My Sounds (no per-waveform synth entries). A synth row reveals **Base → morph →
  Modulator** WAVES pickers. `model.Lane.sound_b` added (+ persistence + `Event.morph/morph_end`).
- **C: the curve now MODULATES (region-based, not flat).** `separationboard._sample_curve` samples
  the Bézier ~10 ms; `_regions` = runs above `HIT_THRESH`; each region → ONE note with `vel=peak`
  (volume/intensity) and `length=width` (so a synth line that never drops to 0 = one HELD note;
  a drum region >0.14 s → `synth.drum_roll` buzz = the "tsssss", else a single hit). Synth notes
  carry `morph=v_start, morph_end=v_end` → `render._voice_for` calls `synth.morph_synth` to glide
  base→modulator across the note. Engine fns `synth.morph_synth` + `synth.drum_roll` (added v0.16.1)
  now wired. Verified headlessly (`board_check.py`): one Synth picker entry; synth sustained line →
  1 held morph note (len 0.85 beat); render exercises morph+roll (2.15 s); Create lands 3 tracks.
  Screenshot `ref/board-synth.png`.
  NOTE semantic change: hits are now REGION-based (a run above threshold = one note), not one-per-
  anchor — draw a dip to 0 to separate notes. `_hits_of` removed.


## ★ PLAN — "make the wave useful": synth engine + previews (user's checklist, do in order)
Locked requirements (user, repeated — DO NOT drop any):
**A. Compare previews (separator bottom bar):**
- [x] ▶ Preview mix — play what you DREW (exists).
- [ ] ▶ Original — play the raw recorded take.
- [ ] ▶ Both — play drawn + original together to compare.
- [ ] all three sweep the red playhead.
**B. Synth = ONE instrument with TWO sound fields (NOT many synth entries):** ✅ v0.17.0
- [x] Instrument picker shows a single "Synth" option (+ each drum + My Sounds). `_collapse_items` drops the per-waveform synth entries.
- [x] Synth track row reveals TWO fields: **Base** + **→ morph** **Modulator** (WAVES pickers). Model: `Lane.sound_b`.
**C. The curve MODULATES (region-based notes):** ✅ v0.17.0
- [x] `_sample_curve` samples the Bézier to ~10 ms; `_regions` = contiguous runs above `HIT_THRESH`.
- [x] Each region = ONE note: `vel = peak` (volume/intensity), `length = width/beat_len`. Synth held note keeps sounding until the line drops to 0.
- [x] Instruments: `render._voice_for` → `drum_roll` when length>0.14 s (the "tsssss"), else one hit.
- [x] Synth MORPH: `Event.morph/morph_end = curve value at region start/end` → `synth.morph_synth` glides base→modulator across the note.
- KNOWN LIMITATION (refine later): morph/volume follow only the region ENDPOINTS (m0→m1 linear ramp) + the synth ADSR, NOT the exact intra-note curve shape (a rise-then-fall peaks aren't captured). True per-sample curve-follow = a later pass.
**D. Synth knobs (a synth-designer section on the track / a panel):** ← NEXT
- [ ] filter cutoff + resonance, ADSR (attack/decay/sustain/release), LFO (rate/depth), drive, glide, octave/pitch, morph depth. Knobs/sliders, live preview. ("seed from my sound" optional.)
**E. intensity for instruments** ✅ (folded into C: velocity from height + roll from width).
Order: A ✅ → B ✅ → C ✅ → **D next**.

## v0.16.3 — Bézier CURVE points (pen-tool handles) + Record master only on the separator
- **Curved lines with control handles** (user's reference = classic vector pen tool: square anchor +
  two round tangent handles). Each board point is now a dict `{t, v, hx, hy}` (was a bare `(t,v)`);
  the line is drawn as a **cubic Bézier** through the anchors (`QPainterPath.cubicTo`, outgoing
  control = anchor+h, incoming = next anchor−h, symmetric handles). Interaction: **click the wave to
  add an anchor, and DRAG while placing to pull out a curve handle** (pen-tool style); grab the round
  **handle circles** (shown for the active track) to reshape; drag the **square anchor** to move it;
  right-click deletes. Handles clamped (|hx|≤0.35, |hy|≤1). `_hit_handle` tests handle circles before
  anchors. Hits still come from anchors above `HIT_THRESH` (curve shape will drive the synth morph +
  per-hit dynamics when that lands). Verified headlessly: place→drag pulls a non-zero handle; anchor
  drag/delete still work; build/apply unchanged (`ref/board-curve.png` shows a smooth S-curve with
  handles).
- **Record master removed from the MAIN screen** (user): the toolbar `rec_master` button is now
  hidden (`setParent(self); hide()` — kept only so `set_master_recording()` state calls stay valid).
  Recording is exclusively the separator's **● Record master** button now. The `⊞ Separator` button
  stays on the main toolbar to open/show the board.

## v0.16.2 — Separator is a REAL independent window (fullscreen finally works) + Record IN the board
User (very frustrated): it's a TWO-SCREEN app; the separator kept behaving as "one inside the other"
and **would not full-screen no matter how many buttons**. ROOT CAUSE (finally): `SeparationBoard`
was a **`QDialog`** — Qt gives dialogs the `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG` hint and GNOME/most WMs
**refuse to maximise/full-screen a dialog**, even parentless+`Qt.Window`. FIX: `SeparationBoard` is
now a plain top-level **`QWidget`** (`super().__init__()`, no parent). Verified headlessly:
`isinstance QWidget and not QDialog`, `isWindow()`, `parent() is None`, and **`showFullScreen()` →
`isFullScreen()==True`**. It's a normal independent window (own taskbar entry) you can throw on the
2nd monitor and F11/maximise. (No QDialog API was used anymore — `create_requested`/`hide`/
`showFullScreen` all work on QWidget.)
- **Record master MOVED into the separator:** a red **● Record master / ■ Stop** button in the
  board top-left (`record_requested` Signal → `MainWindow._toggle_master_record`). While recording,
  the board canvas shows a **live cyan RMS waveform + "● RECORDING…"** (main window pushes
  `recorder.live_env` to `board.canvas.set_live()` each `_tick`; `set_recording(on)` toggles the
  button + canvas state). Take then loads into the same board (existing flow). The toolbar's Record
  master + `⊞ Separator` buttons remain on the main window too.
- Still persistent: open/close via `⊞ Separator` keeps all work (same `self._board` instance).


## v0.16.1 — Separator is a real separate window w/ a button (two-screen) + synth-morph engine started
User (urgent): it's a TWO-SCREEN app. Recording happens "in place" on the main window and the
separator only pops at the END — wrong. Wants a **button to open the "master track"/separator on a
separate screen**, openable/closable **without losing work**; separation happens on the separator
screen, the main screen shows each created track on its own row.
- **New `⊞ Separator` toolbar button** (`toolbar.open_separator` Signal → `MainWindow._open_separator`)
  opens/shows the Separation Board **even before any recording** (fills with silence until a take
  arrives) so you can park it on your 2nd monitor. It re-shows the SAME persistent `self._board`
  instance, so **close + reopen never loses drawn tracks/lines** (verified headlessly: draw → hide →
  reopen → tracks still there). Board creation refactored into `_make_board`; `_on_calc_done` now just
  loads the take (`set_take`) into the existing board and shows it (no more modal-feeling pop).
- Main screen already shows created tracks as rows (after "Create these tracks"); separator is the
  drawing surface. (Still TODO if wanted: show the LIVE mic-capture waveform inside the separator
  during recording instead of on the main timeline.)
- **Synth-morph ENGINE started** in `synth.py` (wiring next): `morph_synth(a,b,freq,dur,vel,m0,m1)`
  = wavetable-style interpolation of two synth waveshapes (m glides m0→m1: 0=all A, 1=all B, 0.5=new
  hybrid — a MORPH, not two notes layered) and `drum_roll(inst,vel,dur,vel_end)` = re-triggered buzz
  so an intensity line turns a 'ts' into a 'tssss' (the jazz snare). NOT yet wired into model/render/
  board rows — that's the immediate next step (see DEFERRED #1).


## v0.16.0 — board is now a PERSISTENT top-level window (fixes full screen) + playhead/tempo/zoom
User reframe (THE GOLDEN RULE): *"the Separation Board should ALWAYS be visible"* — it's the main
surface; they want to keep it up, record on top, add more tracks over time. Also reported: full
screen did nothing, zoom did nothing, and wanted a playhead + on-board tempo.
- **Full screen fixed by making the board a real window.** It was a `QDialog` parented to the
  MainWindow and run with `exec()` (application-modal) — the WM treated it as a modal dialog and
  refused maximise / full screen / moving to another monitor (the user's screenshot showed it stuck
  at dialog size with "Exit full screen" active but no effect). Now it is created with **no parent +
  `Qt.Window`** and shown **non-modally** (`show()`), so it maximises, full-screens (verified
  `isFullScreen()` toggles True/False), and can be dragged to a 2nd monitor. `⛶ Full screen` button
  + **F11** (Esc exits full screen, else hides).
- **Persistent / non-modal (golden rule).** MainWindow keeps `self._board`; `_on_calc_done` creates
  it once and thereafter calls `board.set_take(hp, bpm)` and re-shows it. **"Create these tracks" no
  longer closes it** — the OK button emits `create_requested` (Signal) → `_apply_board_result`, board
  stays open so you keep working. "Close" just hides it. (TRUE record-on-top LAYERING is the next
  step; today `set_take` REPLACES the wave + clears tracks on a new recording.)
- **Red playhead** sweeps during preview: `preview_pattern_cb` now RETURNS the preview duration;
  board runs a `QTimer`+`QElapsedTimer` and draws a red vertical line (`canvas.set_playhead(frac)`).
- **On-board tempo:** a **BPM** `QSpinBox` in the top bar drives `canvas.bpm` (grid redraws) and the
  bpm used for build/preview.
- **Zoom fixed + buttons:** plain **scroll now zooms** around the cursor (no Ctrl needed; also reads
  `pixelDelta` so ThinkPad touchpads work), plus **－ / 100% / ＋** zoom buttons in the top bar
  (`zoom_at(factor)`), label shows the level. Corner navigator unchanged.
Headless `board_check.py` verifies scroll-zoom + zoom buttons + tempo wiring (bpm→140) + playhead
sweep + build + `_apply_board_result` (lanes 4→6, "CREATE WORKS ✓"). App boots v0.16.0; fullscreen
state verified to toggle.

### DEFERRED — the user asked for these; NOT built yet (do next, in this order)
1. **SYNTH morph = two lines (user's detailed idea).** When a track is **synth**, give it TWO
   instrument pickers + TWO lines: a **base** line aligned to the wave CENTRE (sound A) and a **top**
   line at the top of the grid (sound B). The drawn curve height at each moment is the **mixer knob**
   crossfading A→B (centre = 100% A, top = 100% B). Render = blend/morph the two voices by that
   per-time amount. This is the concrete version of the long-deferred "morphing sounds."
2. **Curved (smooth) lines** option (spline through the dots instead of straight segments), tied to
   the synth morph feel.
3. **Record ON TOP / layering (golden rule, full version):** keep existing tracks + drawn lines and
   record additional takes that extend/overlay the wave, instead of replacing it.
4. Solo-hear a single layer on the board; length control per track.

## v0.15.2 — board: real full-screen, drawn-pattern preview, zoom+navigator, busy states, Create fixed
Round of fixes on the Separation Board (`separationboard.py` + `mainwindow.py`):
- **Full screen actually works now.** The board is a `QDialog` but was treated as a plain dialog
  by the WM (couldn't maximise / go full screen / move to a 2nd monitor). Fix: `setWindowFlag(
  Qt.Window, True)` + Maximize/Minimize hints. `⛶ Full screen` button + **F11** toggle
  (Esc exits). Now draggable onto a second screen and full-screenable there.
- **Preview of what you DREW** (not just the instrument): per-track ▶ now plays that track's drawn
  hits with its instrument (`SeparationBoard._lane_events` → `preview_pattern_cb`), and a new
  **▶ Preview mix** (bottom-left) plays all visible tracks together. Falls back to a single
  instrument one-shot if a track has no dots yet. Wired to `MainWindow._preview_pattern` which
  renders a temp `Project` via `render_project` and plays it through `engine.one_shot`.
- **Zoom + pan + bottom-right NAVIGATOR** on the canvas (like the main timeline's minimap):
  `Ctrl+scroll` zooms around the cursor (down to `MIN_SPAN=1%` of the take), plain scroll pans;
  a corner navigator shows the whole take + a cyan viewport rect you drag to move around. Canvas
  keeps points in whole-take fractions but maps through a `(view0,view1)` window; the waveform is
  re-peaked over the visible slice each paint so zooming reveals true detail.
- **Busy / loading states** so nothing looks frozen: after a master recording, tempo + clean-up
  now run **OFF the UI thread** (`calc_done` Signal → `_on_calc_done`) behind a `QProgressDialog`
  spinner ("Calculating your take…"), and **"Creating your tracks…"** shows while building. Also
  **dropped the CLAP `analyze_clusters` call from the record path** — the board is manual, so we
  only need `groove.highpass` + `groove.detect_tempo`. Much faster, no server/LLM/CLAP in this flow.
- **"Create these tracks" now verifiably works.** Split the apply into
  `MainWindow._apply_board_result(board, bpm)` (removes old `auto` lanes, adds the new lanes+events,
  `timeline.set_project`, headers/toolbar refresh, `_commit`, title "created N tracks"). If nothing
  was drawn it says so instead of silently doing nothing. Headless `board_check.py` drives the whole
  path: add tracks → place/drag/delete dots → zoom/pan/navigator → build → `_apply_board_result` on a
  real `MainWindow`: **lanes 4→6, timeline rows=6, 8 events → "CREATE WORKS ✓"**. App boots v0.15.2.

NEXT (still the roadmap): per-track **length** control + the **SYNTH DESIGNER panel**
(osc/filter/ADSR/LFO/FX knobs+sliders+switches, "seed from my sound", live preview); solo-hear a
single layer while drawing; curve→audio by envelope-multiply for true sustained layers.

## v0.15.1 — SEPARATION BOARD is now MANUAL + full-screen (the app's main feature)
User feedback on v0.15.0: the four auto-curves all looked the same and weren't useful. The whole
point is to separate by **instrument / intention** by hand (a "ts" the user hears as a different
instrument). So the board no longer auto-creates layers. Now:
- Starts **empty** (just the waveform). **＋ Add track** (purple, top of the right panel) adds a
  track with its own row: colour swatch, editable name, **instrument dropdown** (`settings.ITEMS`
  = unified Drum/Synth/My-Sounds list, passed in via `instrument_items`), **▶ preview** (plays a
  one-shot via new `MainWindow._preview_instrument(kind, sound)` → `_voice_for` → `engine.one_shot`),
  👁 show/hide, ✕ delete. Active track = coloured border; click a row or a dot to activate.
- **Pen tool** rewritten for manual drawing: **single left-click on the wave places a dot** on the
  active track (and you can drag while held); **drag** a dot to move (dots stay x-ordered);
  **right-click** a dot to delete. Empty active track shows a "click to place points" hint.
- **Full screen:** `⛶ Full screen` button + **F11** toggle (Esc exits full screen); dialog also has
  Maximize/Minimize window buttons (`Qt.WindowMaximizeButtonHint`). Layout is canvas (stretch) +
  300px track panel (`QScrollArea`) so it scales to the whole screen.
- `SeparationBoard.build()` → one lane per visible track using **that track's chosen instrument**
  (kind/sound, `has_original=True` so Original toggle still available, `play_original=False`).
  `_hits_of` = every raised dot (v ≥ `HIT_THRESH` 0.14) is a hit, de-duped < 40 ms; each snapped to
  the real attack (`analysis.onset_start`) and placed on the tempo grid. Synth tracks get pitch 60
  (per-hit pitch + the synth-designer knobs are the NEXT feature).

Files: `separationboard.py` fully rewritten (CurveCanvas + TrackRow + SeparationBoard); wired in
`mainwindow._stop_master_record` (passes `self.settings.items` + `self._preview_instrument`).
Headless: `board_check.py` adds 2 tracks, places/drag/deletes dots, builds lanes → `ref/board-01.png`
(verified: rows render 296×80, build gives 2 kick lanes with 4 & 3 hits). App boots at v0.15.1.

NEXT (user's stated roadmap): per-track **Instrument vs Synth** is half-there (instrument picker);
still want **length** control per track + the **SYNTH DESIGNER panel** (osc/filter/ADSR/LFO/FX knobs
+ sliders + switches, "seed from my sound", live preview) so a synth track can be sculpted to match
what they hear. Also: solo-hear a single layer on the board; curve→audio by envelope-multiply for
true sustained layers.

## v0.15.0 — SEPARATION BOARD (pen-tool layer curves) — the first post-record surface
**Strategic pivot the user asked for:** stop auto-guessing (onset→CLAP→questionnaire) and let the
USER draw the sounds apart. After Record master, `SeparationBoard` (`separationboard.py`) opens
instead of `ReviewDialog`: the take's waveform (red, mirrored around centre) with several **layer
curves** laid on top — **Hits** (blue, transient novelty = HW-rectified diff of the energy env),
**Body** (green, overall RMS env), **Low**/**High** (band-limited envs, hidden by default). Each
curve is a **PEN TOOL**: every control point is a draggable **dot** — drag to move (dots stay
x-ordered so the curve is a function), **double-click** to add a dot to the active layer,
**right-click** a dot to delete. Legend swatches toggle a layer's visibility / set the active
(editable) one. Curves are amplitude envelopes: 0 at the centre line, 1 at the top (matches the
user's own mock-ups exactly). `initial_layers()` auto-computes the starting curves (scipy butter
band-envelopes → `_resample_points` to `N_POINTS=48`, spiky=peak-per-bin for transients else mean)
so you refine, not draw from scratch.

On **"Use these layers →"** `SeparationBoard.build()` turns each VISIBLE curve into its own
**play-original lane**: local maxima of the curve above a threshold become hits, each snapped to
the real attack via `analysis.onset_start` and placed on the tempo grid (`beat = src_t/beat_len`),
slicing the user's real take. This is the FIRST-PASS result — honest time-domain separation (works
for hits apart in time; simultaneous overlaps still lean on the auto band/HPSS split).

NEXT (not built yet): per-layer **Instrument vs Synth** choice + length + the **synth-designer
panel** (osc/filter/ADSR/LFO/FX knobs, "seed from my sound"); curve→audio by envelope-multiply for
true sustained layers; solo-hear each layer on the board. Qwen/arrange path is being retired per
user ("no big LLM on a server, only CLAP-type local AI"). `ReviewDialog`/`build_from_review` are
still imported in `mainwindow.py` but no longer on the record path (kept for reference).

Headless check: `desktop/board_check.py` (offscreen) builds a synthetic take, exercises
drag/add/delete on a dot, builds lanes, saves `ref/board-01.png`. Verified: drag moves a dot,
add 48→49, delete 49→48, curves build 2 lanes with hits. App boots at v0.15.0.

## v0.14.2 — thinking OFF app-wide (user directive)
User: "any model used on this app should ALWAYS be think=false." Enforced centrally in
`llm.chat`: every request gets payload `think:false` AND `_no_think_messages` appends `/no_think`
to the system message (Qwen3 template reads it), and replies are stripped of any `<think>…</think>`
via `_THINK_RE`. Applies to arrange AND the Test ping. Result on the a3b model: arrange 178s→139s
(richer 9-track output). Still server-throughput-bound (35B MoE) — if snappier is ever wanted,
`qwen2.5-coder:14b` would likely be faster, but a3b-no-think is the user's chosen default.

## v0.14.1 — AI arrange VERIFIED LIVE + model-dropdown + freeze fix
**The whole arrange pipeline works end-to-end against the user's REAL home server** (Ollama at
`192.168.2.200:11434`). Test: a 3-track sketch (kick+snare + hummed melody D4/F4) → the model
returned a full 6-track arrangement (Kick/Snare/Hat cleaned + a NEW Bass D2/F2 + Pad D3/F3 + Lead
keeping the melody) with coherent D/F harmony across three octaves. This is the "beatbox a seed →
full track" vision proven. Config saved: `desktop/config.json` = `http://192.168.2.200:11434/v1`,
model **`qwen3.5:35b-a3b`** (fast MoE, ~3B active). NOTE: even warmed, generation took ~178s for
88 notes — usable (off-thread, title shows progress) but SLOW; next optimization = disable qwen3
"thinking" (/no_think) or try `qwen2.5-coder:14b` (9GB, fast, good at JSON). The plain
`qwen2.5:32b-instruct-q4_K_M` TIMED OUT cold at 180s.

Three bugs/UX fixes this patch:
- **Test-connection FREEZE (user hit it):** a bare IP like `192.168.2.200` made `urllib` raise a
  `ValueError` DURING request construction (before the try), and `ping()` only caught `LLMError`,
  so the worker thread died silently → "Testing…" forever. Fixed: `llm.normalize_base_url` (bare
  IP → `http://…:11434/v1`, keeps explicit scheme/port/path), request built INSIDE the try, `ping`
  catches everything, dialog worker double-guards + a live "⏳ Testing … Ns" counter so you always
  know it's alive. Ping timeout 90s (big models load slowly), arrange 300s.
- **Model DROPDOWN (user's idea):** `llm.list_models` hits `/v1/models`; the dialog auto-loads the
  server's models on URL entry / open and shows them in an editable combo + ↻ reload — so you pick
  the exact tag instead of mistyping it (which is what broke it: `qwen2.5:32b-instruct` vs the real
  `…-q4_K_M`). Verified live: lists all 7 of the user's models.

## v0.14.0 — AI ARRANGE LAYER + HPSS ("stop working double") — the strategic pivot
User's insight (correct, restated over several sessions): don't make a model *hear* audio —
turn the beatbox into NUMBERS (our DSP+CLAP already do), then hand that symbolic sketch to a big
reasoning LLM on their **home server**. It reasons over the WHOLE track at once and expands the
sketch into a **full musical arrangement** (long melody behind the ts/pf, bassline, harmony,
cleaned drums), which we render with our own synth engine → user just tweaks. This ends the
"beatbox AND then build the whole track by hand" double-work. Philosophy locked: **musical, not
exact** — `ps ps ps` heard as `psssst ps` is fine if it sounds good; go with the flow like a DAW.

New files: **`config.py`** (desktop/config.json: `ai_base_url`/`ai_model`/`ai_api_key`/`ai_enabled`;
default local Ollama), **`llm.py`** (stdlib-only OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` client —
works with Ollama/vLLM/LM Studio/llama.cpp; `chat()`, `ping()`, `LLMError`), **`arrange.py`**
(`project_to_sketch` → compact symbolic JSON; `_SYSTEM` producer prompt constrained to our
`synth.DRUMS`/`WAVES` vocab; `_extract_json` tolerant of fences/prose; `arrangement_to_project`
coerces bad kind/sound → playable; `arrange()` = full round-trip → new `Project`), **`aidialog.py`**
(AI Settings dialog: editable **URL + model name** + optional key + **Test** (threaded ping) —
user can swap servers/models anytime).

Wiring (`mainwindow.py`): **AI menu** → "✨ Arrange into a full track" (**Ctrl+R**) + "AI Server
Settings…". `_arrange_with_ai` runs the LLM call OFF the UI thread (daemon thread → `arrange_done`
Signal → `_on_arrange_done` swaps the project via `_set_project` + `_commit` so **Ctrl+Z restores
the pre-arrange groove**). If unconfigured it opens Settings first. Errors (dead server, bad JSON)
surface in the title bar, never crash/hang (short timeouts).

**HPSS (`groove.hpss`)** = the "don't cut the background tone" fix (librosa `effects.hpss`, falls
back to (buf,buf)). **`groove.melody_line`** tracks the harmonic layer's continuous pitch and
MERGES contiguous same-pitch frames into HELD notes (allows a few unvoiced frames so a pop over
the tone doesn't split it) → a held tone becomes ONE long note, not one-note-per-hit. Wired into
`extract.analyze_clusters`: computes hpss, and appends a synthetic **melody cluster** (`suggest=
"melody"`, `is_melody=True`, pre-built held-note hits) that flows through the existing review
dialog + `build_from_review` melody path unchanged. VERIFIED headlessly: held A4→C5 tones → 2 clean
held notes (MIDI 69/72, full length); arrange serialize/parse + bad-vocab coercion + dead-server
LLMError all pass; window builds, title shows v0.14.0.

STILL TODO / next: (1) test arrange against the user's REAL home server (need URL + model tag —
they likely run Ollama; `Ollama-Test` folder exists). (2) percussion onsets still run on the full
hp buffer, not the percussive layer — could move them to `perc` to stop the tone spawning drum
onsets (needs real-audio tuning). (3) melody cluster can double-count if a tonal attack also makes
onset clusters — review dialog lets the user "ignore" those for now. (4) still want a real MELODIC
beatbox sample to tune `melody_line` thresholds.


> ⚠️ VERSION GOTCHA: bump `beatstudio/__init__.py __version__` by EDITING the string directly
> (not `sed` find-replace — a lost bump once left every later `sed` searching for a number that
> wasn't there, so the title silently stayed stale while the code advanced). Verify after: the
> title bar must show the new number.

---

## HOW THE APP WORKS NOW (the core loop, as of v0.13.0)

The philosophy pivoted (user's insight): **"My Sounds" pre-registration is BACKWARDS.** The right
flow is beatbox anything → software finds the distinct sounds → **asks you what each is** → builds
with REAL instruments → and **learns your kit** so it recognises them next time ("train along, not
beforehand"). When you press **Record master**:
1. `extract.analyze_clusters()` — high-pass (kills DC rumble) → onsets (spectral flux) → tempo
   (librosa) → quantize to 1/16 grid → cluster by CLAP embedding. Per cluster: a 0.5s preview +
   a SUGGESTED category (from `usermodel` if learnt, else acoustic guess, else pitch→melody) +
   per-hit melody note (`groove.note_of`) + a matched clean synth `preset` (`groove.pick_preset`).
2. `reviewdialog.ReviewDialog` — the QUESTIONNAIRE ("What did you just beatbox?"): one row per
   sound with ▶ (hear YOUR sound), 🔊 (hear the CHOSEN instrument), and a category dropdown
   (kick/snare/hat/…/bass/melody/keep-my-sound/ignore). Shows "(learned)" vs "(guess)".
3. `extract.build_from_review()` — builds tracks with real instruments AND
   `usermodel.add(embedding, category)` for each → learns. Melody category uses the matched synth
   preset + real per-note pitches.
4. `usermodel.UserModel` (`desktop/usermodel/labels.npz`) — CLAP-embedding k-NN. Verified:
   label once → re-analysis auto-recognises the same sounds (conf>0.5).

New files since the earlier changelog: **`usermodel.py`, `reviewdialog.py`**; new funcs in
`groove.py` (`highpass`, `classify_acoustic`, `detect_pitch`, `note_of`, `pick_preset`) and
`extract.py` (`analyze_clusters`, `build_from_review`; old `smart_extract` still there).

## HONEST OPEN ISSUES (priority order for next session)
1. **Tempo unstable** — same file read 92 vs 167 BPM depending on high-pass. Add a confirm/
   tap-tempo step in the questionnaire, or a better beat tracker. This is the shakiest part.
2. **Onset over-detection** — ~56–76 hits on a 30s take; some are breaths, and SUSTAINED melodic
   notes get chopped into many notes. For melody: merge consecutive same-pitch contiguous hits
   into one held note (but keep redobles = re-articulated repeats separate).
3. **Cold-start suggestions rough** — first-time acoustic guesses are often wrong (that's OK by
   design; user corrects once, model learns). Could improve the initial guess.
4. **pick_preset** timbre match is approximate (e.g. low sine → 'bass'). Fine for now.
5. Need a **real MELODIC beatbox sample** from the user to tune note-tracking + timbre. Also want
   Recording 1/2 style drum samples to keep tuning onsets/clustering.

## READING/DEBUGGING REAL AUDIO
- `desktop/analyze.py <file>` runs a recording through the full pipeline + prints tempo/onsets/
  clusters/suggestions + saves a spectrogram PNG. Use it to tune on the user's real audio.
- User's FLACs have BROKEN/STREAMED headers (frames=int64max → libsndfile `psf_fseek` fails,
  soundfile can't read). Decode first with GStreamer (ffmpeg NOT installed):
  `gst-launch-1.0 -q filesrc location=IN.flac ! decodebin ! audioconvert ! audioresample !
   audio/x-raw,format=S16LE,channels=1,rate=44100 ! wavenc ! filesink location=OUT.wav`
- Put user beatbox recordings in `desktop/samples/`.

## What this is / the pivot

`Documents/APPS/Beat` began as a **web app** ("Beatbox to MIDI", `Beatbox to MIDI.dc.html`,
last at web-v0.7.6) that kept **stuttering** (full-canvas repaints in the browser). On
2026-07-01 the user decided to go **native**: a real Linux desktop app, NOT Electron/Tauri
(those are still browser engines). The native app lives in **`desktop/`** and is the primary
product now. The **web app stays as the phone capture companion** (record on the phone
offline → sync to the desktop via `server.py` → open under File ▸ Grooves). Nothing from the
web app was thrown away — its features were ported.

Goal the user keeps restating: **feature parity with the web version**, good recording, and
**AI sound matching** (now shipped).

## How to run

```bash
bash ~/Documents/APPS/Beat/desktop/run.sh          # or double-click the "Beat Studio" desktop icon
```
- Desktop icon installed via `desktop/install-launcher.sh` (icon `desktop/icon.png`,
  `desktop/BeatStudio.desktop`).
- System deps the user already installed: `libxcb-cursor0` (to launch), **`libportaudio2`**
  (REQUIRED for sound + mic).
- Python venv at `desktop/.venv` (created `--system-site-packages`). Key deps:
  PySide6 6.11, numpy, scipy, sounddevice, mido, **torch 2.12 (CPU), transformers 5.12,
  soundfile** (for CLAP AI).
- Controls: **Ctrl+scroll** zoom, **Space** play/stop, **Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z** undo/redo,
  **Ctrl+N** new, **Ctrl+Backspace** clear beats.
- Headless verify pattern (used for all testing):
  `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen BEAT_NO_GL=1 ./.venv/bin/python <script>` and `w.grab().save('ref/x.png')`.
  Reference screenshots (web + native) are in `desktop/ref/`.

**Versioning:** bump `beatstudio/__init__.py` `__version__` on EVERY change — it's shown in
the title bar so the user can confirm a relaunch picked up the new build.

## Architecture / files (`desktop/beatstudio/`)

- **`mainwindow.py`** — assembles everything; transport; recording flow; undo/redo; menu;
  wires all signals. Starts with `empty_project()` (4 empty tracks Kick/Snare/Hat/Square).
- **`timeline.py`** — `QGraphicsView` + OpenGL viewport. Custom-paints ONLY the exposed rect
  in `drawBackground`/`drawForeground` (this is the anti-stutter fix). `setAlignment(Left|Top)`
  so rows line up with headers. Handles beat editing (click-add / drag-move / dbl-click delete /
  snap), marquee select, right-click → per-beat EQ, live record waveform + markers, minimap
  mirror circle.
- **`headers.py`** — left track column (colour chip, name, subtitle, REC/S/M/⚙ buttons,
  Extract/Original toggle for `has_original` lanes, + New track). Custom-painted with hit-testing.
- **`ruler.py`** — top bar-number ruler; drag to set loop region.
- **`toolbar.py`** — ▶ ■ ↺(undo) ↻(redo) 🗑(clear+confirm) 🎤 ♩(metro) BPM · level meter ·
  notes/tracks · Save/Grooves/My Sounds. `_LevelMeter` shows input volume while recording.
- **`settings.py`** — bottom track-settings panel (⚙): instrument picker (unified drum/synth/
  My-Sounds list; KEEPS beats on change), Bass/Mid/Treble EQ, Test, per-track Record,
  Play-Original checkbox, Delete, Close.
- **`synth.py`** — numpy voices: drums, synth presets, sampler (`sample_voice` = resample +
  sustain-loop), 3-band RBJ EQ, metronome click. `SR=44100`.
- **`render.py`** — `render_project(project, samples, orig)` → mono buffer (mute/solo, EQ,
  velocity, note length, metronome, play-original slices). `_voice_for` builds one voice.
- **`audio.py`** — `AudioEngine`: sounddevice OutputStream, loop, live cursor, `one_shot`
  preview; virtual-clock fallback if no PortAudio.
- **`recorder.py`** — `Recorder`: sounddevice InputStream; `live_env` (per-block RMS for the
  live waveform), `live_onsets`, `peak` (clip warn).
- **`analysis.py`** — `onsets_from` (spectral-flux attack detection — see below),
  `seg_features` (24-D: 5 spectral + 6 bands + 13 MFCC), `match_dist`, `onset_start`.
- **`extract.py`** — `multi_extract` = try CLAP → DSP gallery-match → brightness band-split.
  `clap_extract` embeds each hit, matches gallery by cosine or zero-shot classifies.
- **`ai_match.py`** — **CLAP** (`laion/clap-htsat-unfused`): `load()`, `embed()` (512-D, uses
  `out.pooler_output`, resample to 48000, processor kwarg `audio=`), `cosine_dist`, `classify()`
  zero-shot vs text LABELS. Fully local/offline after one-time ~600MB weight download to
  `~/.cache/huggingface`.
- **`sounds.py`** — `SoundLibrary` (`desktop/mysounds/` = index.json + <id>.npy); DSP features +
  CLAP embeddings cached per sound.
- **`soundsdialog.py`** — My Sounds window: list w/ per-sound ▶ buttons, record (live waveform),
  waveform editor (trim/base-pitch/gain/loop), looping Preview.
- **`minimap.py`** — bottom-right hover corner: exact scaled miniature, draggable dot (reaches
  every corner), mirror circle on real grid. `zoombar.py` = −/100%/+ pill stacked ABOVE it.
- **`beateq.py`** — per-beat EQ popover (Tune/Bass/Mid/Treble/Volume on the selection).
- **`persistence.py`** — JSON save/load, `mido` MIDI export, `from_dict` tolerant of the WEB
  groove format (phone sync via `server.py` → `Beat/synced/`).
- **`model.py`** — `Project` / `Lane` / `Event` dataclasses. `empty_project()`, `demo_project()`.

## DONE (feature parity with web, verified headlessly)

Audio playback · transport (play/pause/stop/space, metronome, BPM, loop) · grid editing
(add/move/delete/snap, marquee) · track settings panel (instrument switch keeps beats, EQ,
Test, Delete) · header buttons (REC/solo/mute/gear/+track) · mic recording + onset detection +
live markers + live waveform (per-track AND master full-height) + metronome-while-recording ·
**Record master → auto-split** into instrument tracks · **My Sounds** sampler gallery + waveform
editor + per-sound play + looping preview · **AI matching (CLAP)** with zero-shot fallback (works
WITH or WITHOUT a gallery) · **Extract/Original toggle** per track (header + gear) · per-beat EQ
popover + marquee · minimap (exact miniature + dot + mirror) · zoom controls · MIDI export ·
save/load · phone-sync groove loading · undo/redo (buttons + shortcuts) · clear-all (confirm) ·
starts with a clean empty grid.

### Two hard bugs fixed recently
- **v0.9.1 — onset detection rewrite** (the "giant green note / no rhythm" bug). Old detector was
  level-based and let one hit's note run until energy fell <25% of peak → a single hit became a
  whole-bar note (plus an over-aggressive timbre merge). Now **spectral-flux attack detection**
  (hop 256 / win 1024, positive spectral-change novelty, adaptive-mean threshold ×1.4 + floor,
  45 ms refractory) → ONE onset per hit; note length SHORT by default (decays under 40% of its
  own peak, hard-capped 0.7 s and by the gap to the next onset), NO merge. Verified:
  "pf ts pf ts pf pf" → 6 distinct ~0.05 s hits; a sustained "tsssss" → ~0.47 s.
- **v0.8.2 — vertical misalignment**: `QGraphicsView` centres content smaller than the viewport,
  so rows drifted below the headers. Fixed with `setAlignment(Qt.AlignLeft|Qt.AlignTop)`.
- **v0.9.3 — row misalignment (second cause)**: the track-header column had an internal
  `_HEADER_BAND` (=RULER_H) caption strip that pushed its rows down 26px while the timeline rows
  started at y=0. Fixed: `_HEADER_BAND = 0` (rows start at 0, aligned to the grid) and the
  "TRACK · REC · SOLO · MUTE" caption moved into the `CornerBox` (grid row 0, col 0). Verified
  header row 0 and timeline row 0 share the same global top (0px diff).
- **v0.9.2/0.9.3 — undo/redo buttons**: always present in the toolbar (↺ ↻), GREYED (disabled
  `:disabled` style) when the stack is empty — never hidden, never shift the layout (per user
  request). Enable on first edit / after undo.

## v0.12.0 — REVIEW QUESTIONNAIRE + "TRAIN ALONG" (the right architecture)

Reframed per the user: "My Sounds" (pre-registering sounds) is BACKWARDS. Correct flow =
beatbox anything → software finds the distinct sounds → **ask the user what each one is** →
build with REAL instruments → and LEARN so it recognises them next time. No pre-registration;
labelling happens AFTER, and doubles as training data.

Flow now (`_stop_master_record`):
1. `extract.analyze_clusters(buf, sr, start, usermodel)` → high-pass, onsets, tempo, quantize,
   cluster (CLAP), and per cluster: a representative 0.5s preview + a SUGGESTED category
   (from `usermodel` if learnt, else acoustic guess `groove.classify_acoustic`, else pitch→melody).
2. `reviewdialog.ReviewDialog` — a per-sound questionnaire: ▶ play example, pick instrument from
   `usermodel.CATEGORIES` (kick/snare/hat/…/bass/melody/keep-my-sound/ignore), shows "(learned)"
   vs "(guess)".
3. `extract.build_from_review(clusters, decisions, usermodel)` → tracks with real instruments,
   AND `usermodel.add(embedding, category)` for each → **learns your kit** (persisted).
4. `usermodel.UserModel` (`desktop/usermodel/labels.npz`): CLAP-embedding k-NN classifier;
   `predict()` = nearest-fingerprint vote. Verified: after labelling once, re-analysis
   auto-recognises 9/9 sounds (conf>0.5). This IS "train along, not beforehand."

NOTE: "My Sounds" gallery still exists but is now secondary; the review flow is the main path.
Acoustic suggestions are rough (cold start) but the user corrects them once and the model learns.
Tempo detection still unstable (Recording 2: 92 pre-HP, 167 post-HP) — needs work/confirm-in-UI.

## v0.10.0 — MUSICAL PIPELINE (the "random rhythm" fix)

The big fix for "the result is random as fuck." Master record now runs a real MIR pipeline
(`groove.py` + `extract.smart_extract`), replacing the raw-onset placement:
1. **Onsets** (spectral flux, `analysis.onsets_from`).
2. **Tempo** — `groove.detect_tempo` (librosa `feature.rhythm.tempo`, IOI-median fallback);
   sets `project.bpm`. Verified: recovers 120 BPM from a humanized take.
3. **Quantize** — `groove.quantize` snaps every hit to the nearest 1/16 with a circular-mean
   phase, anchored so the earliest hit = beat 0 → clean 0.25 multiples (verified maxGridErr 0.0).
4. **Cluster** — `groove.cluster` (sklearn AgglomerativeClustering cosine / numpy fallback)
   groups hits by CLAP embedding so the SAME sound → ONE track; each cluster centroid matched to
   nearest instrument / My Sound (`extract._label_centroid`).

Deps added: **librosa, scikit-learn** (in `.venv`). Also: **beat LED** in the toolbar
(`toolbar.pulse_beat`) blinks every beat while recording (green, red on the downbeat); the
metronome click now plays during record only if enabled, but the LED ALWAYS blinks
(`_start_beat_clock` / `_metro_click`) — fixes "metronome does nothing on record."

Cluster threshold (`groove.cluster thresh=0.35`) may merge similar synth sounds (test gave 2
tracks for kick/snare/hat) — tune on real beatbox.

## KNOWN GAPS / TODO (still not at web parity)

1. **Per-lane volume-automation curves** (draggable gain points along a lane) — not ported.
2. **Quantize + sensitivity controls** — web had global quantize + onset-sensitivity; not ported.
3. **Record countdown** (3-2-1 before capture) — not ported.
4. **AI matching** — v0.9.4 switched to AUDIO-TO-AUDIO: `ai_match.instrument_refs()` renders each
   built-in voice, embeds it with CLAP, and `nearest_instrument(emb)` returns the closest; a My
   Sound only wins if it's closer (`clap_extract`). Verified built-in voices self-match 7/7 (~0
   dist). Real-beatbox→synth-reference has a domain gap; the BEST results come from the user
   recording their own kick/snare/hat into My Sounds (real→real). Could bundle real one-shot
   samples as references later. Text zero-shot `classify()` still exists but is no longer the
   primary path. `instrument_refs()` is prebuilt in the AI preload thread.
5. **Undo/redo buttons looked "missing"** — they ARE present (↺ ↻ in the toolbar) but start
   DISABLED (nothing to undo yet); v0.9.2 added a visible `:disabled` style so they're dim-but-
   clearly-there. If the user still says they're missing, double-check the relaunch picked up the
   new version (title bar).
6. Live-monitor (🎤) and phone-sync (📡) toolbar buttons are placeholders/partial.

## NOTES for whoever continues

- The user is a beatboxer, non-developer, and gets frustrated when asked to confirm instead of
  acting — **just build, don't over-ask**. Bump the version each change so they can see it landed.
- CLAP is **local/offline** after the first weight download — this was a point of confusion;
  reassure if asked. **Ollama can NOT do this** (text/vision LLM only, no audio embeddings).
- The user's real test phrase is "pf ts pf ts pf pf" (kick/hat pattern). Recording quality +
  rhythm is what they judge on. After the v0.9.1 onset fix, ask them to re-test.
- Memory file: `~/.claude/projects/-home-sebastian-Documents-APPS/memory/beat_project.md`.
- Web app changelog/status: `Beat/PROGRESS.md` (the OTHER progress file, for the web build).
